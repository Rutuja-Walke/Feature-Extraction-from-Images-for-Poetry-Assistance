# Feature-Extraction-from-Images-for-Poetry-Assistance

In this project Object-based, scene-based and emotion-based features were extracted from a given image and
these features were used to generate a poem.




The primary goals of this project were following:
1. Research Part: To provide motivation to artists for creation of poetry based on images
and scenes.
2. Development Part: To provide a user interface where artists can insert images and
obtain computer generated poetic hints.



The Research Part was broken down into a sequence of steps as described below. The success
of each step was highly dependent on the working of the previous steps:
1. Image Classification
2. Image Captioning
3. Tagging
4. Emotion Extraction
5. Poetry Generation
6. Development
